Story Ideas:
Two Gods debate on the whether a being created from matter and given free will could persist. After coming to an impass, they decided to 
One resource: trees from 'magic forest' which regrows quickly. Player is a summoner from a village with a balance with 'the forest', thousands of years his villages has existed in balance, cut off from the rest of Ard.

Summoners will move from city to city to create units so that your 'tech' is based upon the positioning of your summoners.
Certain cities allow building of certain units
Units require resources to build
Resources can be(gold, wheat, iron, wood, etc?) More will make resource management more complex, less will make it easier...
Resource may need to be transported to the appropriate city as well... not sure about this
Summoners may have a 'strength' so that they can create units more or less cheaply
Rather than turn based, units have 'initiative'(like that gladiator game)
Summoners could also be wizards which can case storms and alter terrain and do other fun things
should have an econ balance similar to starcraft so that moving across a map takes a relatively short amount of time(compared to producing units)
