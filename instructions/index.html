Summoners, Altars and Mana

Summoners, although lacking in strength and fortitude, are the most powerful units on Ard. Summoners, as their name implies, are used to create, i.e. summon, other units. When a summoner is at an Altar you will be able to command him to 'Start Summoning'. Once a summoner has entered this meditative summoning state, you will be able to create units by clicking the 'summon' button next to the unit of your choice in the Build Menu. Additionally, units can be made more powerful by clicking the 'research' button in the Research Menu to increase their level. Of course, units cannot be summoned and leveled endlessly. The Mana cost of these actions along with the time they will take to complete is indicated. Any build or research commands given to a summoner will be executed in the order given and can be viewed and cancelled in the Queue Menu. You should be careful to protect your summoners as the game progresses, once a summoner begins summoning he will not be able to move or attack again.

The cost of units is indicated by two colors of mana, red and blue. Your pools of Mana are indicated in the upper right of the screen and your summoners will not be able to do any actions unless you have the necessary Mana available. 

Gatherers

Gatherers, as you may have guessed, are used to replenish your Mana as you spend it on units. The Red and Blue-leaved trees found in the forests of Ard are the source of all Mana. When a Gatherer is at a Red or Blue tree, he will be able to enter a similar meditative state as the summoner by giving him the command to 'Start Gathering'. Similarly to the summoner, once a gatherer has begun gathering Mana, he will not be able to move or attack. Nothing else need be done after a gather has been commanded to begin. You should periodically see your Red or Blue Mana increase as long as your meditating gatherer is alive.

Units

Health

The health of a unit indicates how much damage it can sustain before being destroyed. Once a unit's health is reduced to zero, it is sent away from Ard to the

Leveling a unit type will drastically increase it's attack power, health, and armor. The level of a unit simply serves as a multiplier for these stats. I.E. if a level 1 unit has 10 attack, 15 health, and 1 armor, at level 2 this unit type would have 10 attack, 30 health, and 2 armor. At level 10 it would have 100 attack, 150 health, and 10 armor. Of course, the Mana required to summon a high level unit is also increased. Similariy to it's stats, the Red Mana and Blue Mana cost of summoning is also multiplied by the unit's level. You may, at this point, think that high level units are useless given that a level 2 unit would cost as much as 2 level 1 units. However, you should note that a 'denser' army can concentrate it's power and that the time to build 2 level 1 units would be twice as long.
