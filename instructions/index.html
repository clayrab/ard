Once a summoner has entered this meditative summoning state, you will be able to create units by clicking the 'summon' button next to the unit of your choice in the Build Menu. Additionally, units can be made more powerful by clicking their 'research' button in the Research Menu. Of course, units cannot be summoned and upgraded for endlessly. The cost of these actions along with the time they will take to complete is indicated. Any build or research commands given to a summoner will be executed in the order given and can be viewed and cancelled in the Queue Menu. You should be careful to protect your summoners as the game progresses, once a summoner begins summoning he will not be able to move or attack again.
